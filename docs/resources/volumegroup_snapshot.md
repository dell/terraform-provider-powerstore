# powerstore_volumegroup_snapshot (Resource)

Volume Group Snapshot resource
This resource is used to manage the volumegroup snapshot entity of PowerStore Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the volumegroup snapshot using this resource. We can also import an existing host from volumegroup snapshot array.

~> **Note:** `volume_group_id`/`volume_group_name` is the required attribute to create volume group snapshot.  
~> **Note:** `expiration_timestamp` if present in config cannot be blank(""). if absent, default value is allocated to it.  
~> **Note:** During create operation, if `expiration_timestamp` is not specified or set to blank(""), snapshot will be created with infinite retention.  
~> **Note:** During modify operation, to set infinite retention, `expiration_timestamp` can be set to blank("").  
~> **Note:** Volume group DataSource can be used to fetch volume group ID/Name.  
~> **Note:** Exactly one of `volume_group_id` and `volume_group_name` should be provided.

# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check volumegroup_snapshot_import.tf for more info
# name and volume_group_id/volume_group_name are the required attributes to create volume group snapshot.
# description and expiration_timestamp are the optional attributes.
# Either volume_group_id or volume_group_name should be present.
# VolumeGroup DataSource can be used to fetch volume group ID/Name.
# During create operation, if expiration_timestamp is not specified or set to blank(""), snapshot will be created with infinite retention.
# During modify operation, to set infinite retention, expiration_timestamp can be set to blank("").
# To check which attributes of the volume group snapshot resource can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

resource "powerstore_volumegroup_snapshot" "test" {
  name                 = "test_snap"
  volume_group_id      = "075aeb23-c782-4cce-9372-5a2e31dc5138"
  expiration_timestamp = "2023-05-06T09:01:47Z"
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, device would have been created on the PowerStore array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# Below are the steps to import volume group snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a volume group snapshot , we need the id of that volume group snapshot
# Step 2 - To check the id of the volume group snapshot we can make Get request to volume group snapshot endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/volume_group --header 'type: Snapshot' which will return list of all volume group snapshots ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file.
# eg.
#resource "powerstore_volumegroup_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
#}
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_volumegroup_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
