# powerstore_hostgroup (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the host group entity of PowerStore Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the host group using this resource. We can also import an existing host group from PowerStore array.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `host_ids` and `host_names` is required.  
~> **Note:** `host_connectivity` cannot be used while creating host group resource but it can be used while updating the host group resource.  

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check host_group_import.tf for more info
# name and host_ids are the required attributes to create and update
# description is the optional attribute
# Host datasource can be used to fetch host id/name.
# To check which attributes of the host resource can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

resource "powerstore_hostgroup" "test" {
  name        = "test_hostgroup"
  description = "Creating host group"
  host_ids    = ["42c60954-ea71-4b50-b172-63880cd48f99"]
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, host group would have been created on the PowerStore array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# Below are the steps to import host group :
# Step 1 - To import a host group, we need the id of that host group
# Step 2 - To check the id of the host group we can make use of host group datasource to read required/all host group ids. Alternatively, we can make Get request to host group endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/host_group which will return list of all host group ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file.
# eg.
# resource "powerstore_hostgroup" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
# }
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_hostgroup.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_hostgroup" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
