# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import, check import.tf for more info
# name, rpo and remote_system_id are required attributes to create and update
# To check which attributes of the replication rule can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

resource "powerstore_replication_rule" "test" {
  name             = "terraform_replication_rule"
  rpo              = "One_Hour"
  remote_system_id = "db11abb3-789e-47f9-96b5-84b5374cbcd2"
  alert_threshold  = 1000
  is_read_only     = false
}

//Below example is for import operation
/*resource "powerstore_replication_rule" "terraform-provider-test-import" {
}*/
```

After the execution of above resource block, replication rule would have been created on the PowerStore array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

# Below are the steps to import replication rule :
# Step 1 - To import a replication rule, we need the id of that replication rule 
# Step 2 - To check the id of the replication rule, we can make Get request to replication rule endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/replication_rule which will return list of all replication rule ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file. 
# eg. 
# resource "powerstore_replication_rule" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
# }
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_replication_rule.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_replication_rule" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
