# powerstore_filesystem_snapshot (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the filesystem snapshot entity of PowerStore Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the filesystem snapshot using this resource. We can also import an existing filesystem snapshot from PowerStore array.

## Example Usage

# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check powerstore_filesystem_snapshot/import.tf for more info
# filesystem_id is the required attribute to create file system snapshot.
# name, expiration_timestamp, access_type and description are the optional attributes
# if name is present in the config it cannot be blank("").
# During create operation, if expiration_timestamp is not specified or set to blank(""), snapshot will be created with infinite retention.
# During modify operation, to set infinite retention, expiration_timestamp can be set to blank("").
# To check which attributes of the file system snapshot resource can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

# To create a file system snapshot, we shall:
# 1. get the id of the filesystem to be snapshotted
data "powerstore_filesystem" "us_east_sales_catalog_fs" {
  name = "us_east_sales_catalog_fs"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.filesystems) == 0
      error_message = "Expected a single filesystem for US East sales catalog, but got ${length(self.filesystems)}"
    }
  }
}

# 2. create an expiration timestamp in the RFC3339 format
resource "time_offset" "us_east_sales_catalog_snapshot_expiration_timestamp" {
  // this will set expiration timestamp to 2 years 1 month from the time of creation of the snapshot
  offset_years  = 2
  offset_months = 1
}

# 3. take the snapshot 
resource "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "us_east_sales_catalog_snapshot" {
  name                 = "us_east_sales_catalog_snapshot"
  description          = "Snapshot of US East Sales Catalog"
  filesystem_id        = data.powerstore_filesystem.us_east_sales_catalog_fs.filesystems[0].id
  expiration_timestamp = time_offset.us_east_sales_catalog_snapshot_expiration_timestamp.rfc3339
  access_type          = "Snapshot"
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, filesystem snapshot would have been created on the PowerStore array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

- `filesystem_id` (String) ID of the filesystem to take snapshot. Cannot be updated.

### Optional

- `access_type` (String) Access type of the filesystem snapshot. Access type can be 'Snapshot' or 'Protocol'. Cannot be updated.
- `description` (String) Description of the filesystem snapshot.
- `expiration_timestamp` (String) Expiration Timestamp of the filesystem snapshot, if not provided there will no expiration for the snapshot. To remove the expiration timestamp, specify it as an empty string. Only UTC (+Z) format is allowed eg: 2023-05-06T09:01:47Z
- `name` (String) Name of the filesystem snapshot.The default name of the filesystem snapshot is the date and time when the snapshot is taken.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the filesystem snapshot.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a filesystem snapshot , we need the id of that filesystem snapshot
# Step 2 - To check the id of the filesystem snapshot we can make Get request to filesystem snapshot endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/file_system and 'filesystem_type: Snapshot' which will return list of all filesystem snapshots ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file.
# eg.
# resource "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
# }
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
