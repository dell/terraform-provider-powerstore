# powerstore_volume_snapshot (Resource)

volume snapshot resource

~> **Note:** `volume_id`/`volume_name` is the required attribute to create volume snapshot.  
~> **Note:** if `name` is present in the config it cannot be blank(""). if absent, default value is allocated to it.  
~> **Note:** During create operation, if `expiration_timestamp` is not specified or set to blank(""), snapshot will be created with infinite retention.  
~> **Note:** During modify operation, to set infinite retention, `expiration_timestamp` can be set to blank("").  
~> **Note:** Volume DataSource can be used to fetch volume ID/Name for volume snapshot creation.  
~> **Note:** Exactly one of `volume_id` and `volume_name` should be provided.

## Schema

### Optional

- `creator_type` (String) Creator Type of the volume snapshot.
- `description` (String) Description of the volume snapshot.
- `expiration_timestamp` (String) Expiration Timestamp of the volume snapshot.Only UTC (+Z) format is allowed.
- `name` (String) Name of the volume snapshot.The default name of the volume snapshot is the date and time when the snapshot is taken.
- `performance_policy_id` (String) Performance Policy id of the volume snapshot. Valid values are default_medium, default_low, default_high.
- `volume_id` (String) ID of the volume to take snapshot. Conflicts with `volume_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `volume_name` (String) Name of the volume to take snapshot. Conflicts with `volume_id`. Cannot be updated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the volume snapshot.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a volume snapshot , we need the id of that volume snapshot
# Step 2 - To check the id of the volume snapshot we can make Get request to volume snapshot endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/volume --header 'type: Snapshot' which will return list of all volume snapshots ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file.
# eg.
# resource "powerstore_volume_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
# }
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_volume_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
