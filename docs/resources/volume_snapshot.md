## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a volume snapshot , we need the id of that volume snapshot
# Step 2 - To check the id of the volume snapshot we can make Get request to volume snapshot endpoint. eg. https://10.0.0.1/api/rest/volume --header 'type: Snapshot' which will return list of all volume snapshots ids.
# Step 3 - Add empty resource block in tf file.
# eg.
# resource "powerstore_volume_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
  # (resource arguments)
# }
# Step 4 - Execute the command: terraform import "powerstore_volume_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
