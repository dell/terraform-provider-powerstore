# powerstore_filesystem (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing File System from PowerStore array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

## Example Usage

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# This datasource reads filesystems either by id or name where user can provide a value to any one of them
# If it is a empty datsource block , then it will read all the filesystems
# If id or name is provided then it reads a particular filesystem with that id or name
# Only one of the attribute can be provided among id and name

# Fetching all filesystems with a specific name
data "powerstore_filesystem" "us_east_sales_catalog_fs" {
  name = "us_east_sales_catalog_fs"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.filesystems) > 0
      error_message = "Expected atleast one filesystem, but got none"
    }
  }
}

# Fetching filesystems using filter expression
data "powerstore_filesystem" "east_sales_catalog_fs" {
  filter_expression = "and=(name.ilike.*_east_sales_catalog_fs*, size_used.gt.594849)"
}

# Fetching a filesystem using id
data "powerstore_filesystem" "filesystem_by_id" {
  id = "6568282e-c982-62ce-5ac3-52518d324736"
}

# Fetching all filesystems under a NAS server
data "powerstore_nas_server" "nas_server_us_east" {
  name = "nas_server_us_east"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.nas_servers) == 1
      error_message = "Expected a single NAS server for US East region, but got none"
    }
  }
}

data "powerstore_filesystem" "file_systems_us_east" {
  nas_server_id = data.powerstore_nas_server.nas_server_us_east.nas_servers[0].id
}

# Fetching all filesystems
data "powerstore_filesystem" "all_file_systems" {
}

// Output all filesystem details
output "filesystem_all_details" {
  value = data.powerstore_filesystem.all_file_systems.filesystems
}

// Output only filesystem names
output "filesystem_names_only" {
  value = data.powerstore_filesystem.all_file_systems.filesystems.*.name
}

// Output filesystem name and access policy with filesystem id as key
output "name_and_access_policy" {
  value = {
    for filesystem in data.powerstore_filesystem.all_file_systems.filesystems : filesystem.id => {
      name = filesystem.name
      access_policy = filesystem.access_policy
    }
  }
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_filesystem.test1` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
