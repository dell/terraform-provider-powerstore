# powerstore_protectionpolicy (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing protection policy from PowerStore array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** Only one of `name` or `id` can be provided at a time.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# This datasource reads protection policies either by id or name where user can provide a value to any one of them
# If it is a empty datsource block , then it will read all the protection policies
# If id or name is provided then it reads a particular protection policy with that id or name
# Only one of the attribute can be provided among id and  name 

# Fetching protection policy using filter expression
data "powerstore_protectionpolicy" "test1" {
  filter_expression = "name=eq.protectionpolicy-ny"
}

data "powerstore_protectionpolicy" "test1" {
  name = "terraform_protection_policy_2"
}

# Output all Protection Policy Details
output "protection_policy_all_details" {
  value = data.powerstore_protectionpolicy.test1.policies
}

# Output only Protection Policy names
output "protection_policy_names_only" {
  value = data.powerstore_protectionpolicy.test1.policies.*.name
}

# Output Protection Policy IDs and volumes with Protection Policy name as key
output "nfs_export_name_and_path" {
  value = {
    for policy in data.powerstore_protectionpolicy.test1.policies : policy.name => {
      name = policy.id
      volumes = policy.volumes  
    }
  }
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_protectionpolicy.test1.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
