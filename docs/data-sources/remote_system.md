# powerstore_remote_system (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing Remote Systems from a PowerStore Array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** Only one of `name`, `id` or `filter_expression` can be provided at a time.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve

# fetching all Remote Systems on the array
data "powerstore_remote_system" "all_remote_systems" {
}

# fetching Remote System using id
data "powerstore_remote_system" "remote_system_by_id" {
  id = "6732e829-29c9-7fed-686a-ee23cab1d298"
}

# fetching Remote System using name
data "powerstore_remote_system" "remote_system_by_name" {
  name = "RT-D4538"
}

# Fetching Remote Systems using filter expression
# This filter expression will fetch a Remote System with the particular management IP
data "powerstore_remote_system" "remote_system_by_filters" {
  filter_expression = "management_address=eq.10.225.225.10"
}

# Output all Remote System Details
output "remote_systems_all_details" {
  value = data.powerstore_remote_system.all_remote_systems.remote_systems
}

# Output only Remote System IDs
output "remote_systems_IDs_only" {
  value = data.powerstore_remote_system.all_remote_systems.remote_systems.*.id
}

# Output Remote System capabilities and serial numbers with Remote System name as key
output "remote_system_capabilities_and_serial_number" {
  value = {
    for remote_system in data.powerstore_remote_system.all_remote_systems.remote_systems : remote_system.name => {
      capabilities = remote_system.capabilities
      serial_number = remote_system.serial_number
    }
  }
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_remote_system.remote_system_by_filters.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter_expression` (String) PowerStore filter expression to filter Remote Systems by. Conflicts with `id` and `name`.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the Remote System to be fetched. Conflicts with `name` and `filter_expression`.
- `name` (String) Name of the Remote System to be fetched. Conflicts with `id` and `filter_expression`.

### Read-Only

- `remote_systems` (Attributes List) List of Remote Systems fetched from PowerStore array. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--remote_systems))

<a id="nestedatt--remote_systems"></a>
