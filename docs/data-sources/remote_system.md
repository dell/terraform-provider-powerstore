# powerstore_remote_system (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing Remote Systems from a PowerStore Array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** Only one of `name`, `id` or `filter_expression` can be provided at a time.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve

# fetching all Remote Systems on the array
data powerstore_remote_system all_remote_systems {
}

# fetching Remote System using id
data powerstore_remote_system remote_system_by_id {
  id = "6732e829-29c9-7fed-686a-ee23cab1d298"
}

# fetching Remote System using name
data powerstore_remote_system remote_system_by_name {
  name = "RT-D4538"
}

# fetching Remote Systems using filter expression
# here, we are fetching a Remote System with a particular management IP
data powerstore_remote_system remote_system_by_filters {
  filter_expression = "management_address=eq.10.225.225.10"
}

output all_remote_systems {
  value = data.powerstore_remote_system.all_remote_systems.remote_systems
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_remote_system.remote_system_by_filters.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
