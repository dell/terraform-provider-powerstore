# powerstore_replication_rule (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing replication rule from PowerStore array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.
> **Note:** Only one of `name` or `id` can be provided at a time.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# This datasource reads replication rules either by id or name where user can provide a value to any one of them
# If it is a empty datsource block , then it will read all the replication rules
# If id or name is provided then it reads a particular replication rule with that id or name
# Only one of the attribute can be provided among id and  name 

# Get replication rule details using name
resource "powerstore_replication_rule" "test" {
  name             = "terraform_replication_rule"
  rpo              = "One_Hour"
  remote_system_id = "db11abb3-789e-47f9-96b5-84b5374cbcd2"
  alert_threshold  = 1000
  is_read_only     = false
}

data "powerstore_replication_rule" "test" {
  depends_on = [powerstore_replication_rule.test]
  name       = "terraform_replication_rule"
}

# Get replication rule details using ID
resource "powerstore_replication_rule" "test" {
  name             = "terraform_replication_rule"
  rpo              = "One_Hour"
  remote_system_id = "db11abb3-789e-47f9-96b5-84b5374cbcd2"
  alert_threshold  = 1000
  is_read_only     = false
}

data "powerstore_replication_rule" "test" {
  id = powerstore_replication_rule.test.id
}

output "replicationRule" {
  value = data.powerstore_replication_rule.test.replication_rules
}
```
After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_snapshotrule.test1.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
