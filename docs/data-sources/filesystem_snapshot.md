# powerstore_filesystem_snapshot (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing File System Snapshot from PowerStore array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** Only one of `name` or `id` can be provided at a time.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# This datasource reads hosts either by id or name where user can provide a value to any one of them
# If it is a empty datsource block , then it will read all the filesystem 
# If id or name is provided then it reads a particular file system snapshot with that id or name
# If filesystem_id is provided then it will read all the filesystem snapshots within filesystem
# Only one of the attribute can be provided among id or name 

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using name
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test1" {
  name = "co015nap5hot"
}

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using id
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test2" {
  id = "6568282e-c982-62ce-5ar3-52518f324723"
}

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using filesystem id
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test2" {
  filesystem_id = "65637292e-c982-62ce-5ar3-52518f44229"
}

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using nas server id
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test3" {
  nas_server_id = "654b2182-f674-f39a-66fc-52518d324736"
}

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using name and nas server id
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test4" {
  name          = "co015nap5hot"
  nas_server_id = "654b2182-f674-f39a-66fc-52518d324736"
}

#Fetching filesystem snapshot using name and file system id
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test4" {
  name          = "co015nap5hot"
  filesystem_id = "65637292e-c982-62ce-5ar3-52518f44229"
}


# Fetching all filesystems
data "powerstore_filesystem_snapshot" "test4" {
}


output "result" {
  value = data.powerstore_filesystem_snapshot.test3.filesystems
}
```
After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerstore_filesystem_snapshot.test1` where name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
