If a replication rule is used by storage resources through one or more protection policies,\nRPO of a replication rule can only be modified to Zero when the system supports RPO Zero for all current associated storage resources.\nModification of the 'rpo' value to or from Zero (sync replication) is not allowed when the rule is in use by a policy assigned to a NAS server.

Private key presented in the request should be encrypted in PKCS8 format. For the current release following services are supported - Import_HTTP, LDAP_HTTP, Syslog_HTTP, SecurID_HTTP, Remote_Backup_HTTP for which the certificate can be imported. CA certificates of type CA_Client_Validation and CA_Server_Validation are supported for all service types. If the imported client/server certificate with is_current flag is set to true and corresponding CA Client Validation or CA Server Validation certificate's is_current flag is not set or updated to true , will cause a loss in connection to the client/server. There can be multiple CA certs for a given service with is_current flag set to true. But for client/server certificates, setting the is_current flag to true on the new certificate will delete the existing current certificate.\nWas added in version 2.0.0.0.",

The relationship will be created for both directions, which enables remote replication capabilities for storage resources on either of the PowerStore systems.  Data connections are configured based on the local and remote storage networks that are defined to be used for replication data transfer.  When a remote system is created for a remote PowerStore, both systems automatically discover the available local and remote storage networks that are tagged for replication.   Then a default network group will be created with the local and remote storage networks tagged for replication use-cases.\n\nFor block import to PowerStore, remote systems can be created for PS_Equalogic, Storage_Center, XtremeIO, NetApp, PowerMax/VMAX, VNX, and some universal storage systems. For VNX and Unity, both block and file import are supported. Unity, Storage_Center, XtremeIO, and VNX remote systems can be created with data connection type of iSCSI or FC.  PS_Equalogic and NetApp can only be created with data connection type of iSCSI.  PowerMax/VMAX can only be created with data connection type of FC.\n\nFor VNX, Unity, PS_Equallogic, Storage_Center, XtremeIO, and NetApp remote systems with iSCSI as the data connection type, the following parameters are required:\n* Management address - Either an IP address or FQDN.\n* Type of remote system\n* Name\n* Description\n* Remote administrator credentials\n* iSCSI address - IPv4 address only\n* CHAP mode for discovery or session\n* CHAP secrets details\n\nFor VNX, Unity, Storage_Center, XtremeIO, and PowerMax/VMAX remote systems with FC as the data connection type, the following parameters are required:\n* Management address - Either an IP address or FQDN.\n* Type of remote system\n* Name\n* Description\n* Remote administrator credentials\n* Data Connection Type - FC\n* Management Port - Management port is applicable only for PowerMax/VMAX remote system.\n\nFor VNX remote systems for file import, include the following parameters along with above block parameters for both block and file import or only below file parameters for file import only cases:\n* File connection address - Control station IP address of the VNX.\n* VNX as type of remote system\n* NAS admin username\n* NAS admin password\n* Name\n* Description\n\nTo create unified (Block and File) Unity remote systems, the following parameters are required:\n* Management address - Either an IP address or FQDN.\n* Unity as type of remote system\n* Description\n* Remote administrator credentials\n* iSCSI address - IPv4 address only\n* Data Connection type - iSCSI\n* CHAP mode for discovery or session\n* CHAP secrets details\n* Unity file details\n\nTo create a Data Domain remote system, the following parameters are required:\n* Management address - Either an IP address or FQDN.\n* Type of remote system\n* Name\n* Description\n* Remote user name\n* Remote user password\n* Data Domain details\n\nTo create a universal remote system, the following parameters are required:\n* Management address - IP address or FQDN.\n* Universal as the type of remote system\n* Name\n* Description\n* Data Connection Type - iSCSI/FC\n* iSCSI address - IPv4 address applicable only for data connection type iSCSI\n* CHAP mode for discovery or session - applicable only for data connection type iSCSI\n* CHAP secrets details - applicable only for data connection type iSCSI\n* Universal details - applicable only for data connection type FC\n\nBased on the type of remote system and version of PowerStore software, the system will automatically determine the capabilities for that remote system.\nAfter the remote system relationship is created, the local system can communicate with the remote system, and open data connections for data transfer.\n",

During cutover the production file interfaces are\ndisabled on the source system and are enabled on the destination system. In case of SMB import, the switchover is disruptive for the clients and the Active Directory configuration is imported if needed. In case of NFS import, the switchover is transparent as file handles are preserved, NLM locks are reclaimed on the destination.\nThe incremental background data copy operation begins after the cutover completes. The filesystem data is moved to the destination in the background. The destination system serves the clients; data requested by the client is synced immediately; write operations are synced back to the source system before acknowledging, so the source remains authoritative and a rollback is possible at any moment. I/O throughput is degraded at this stage. The service is interrupted if the source data becomes unavailable. When all files are synced, the status of the file import session is changedtransitions to 'Ready_For_Commit'.\nIf cutover operation fails, a rollback is attempted and clients are switched back to the source system (may be disruptive). If it succeeds, the stateoperation becomes 'Ready_For_Cutover' again and the operationcutover can be retried. If it fails, the file import session cleans up the destination resources of the import and enters the 'Failed' state.\n\nWas added in version 3.0.0.0.",

A job instance response body is being returned instead of a normal response.\n* 204 - Successful completion with no response body. Typical for deletes, modifies, and any other actions with no outputs. If all the outputs from an action are optional, that action can return 204 if none of the outputs are returned, or 200 if any are.\n* 206 - Successful completion with partial GET response.\n* 207 - Completion of bulk or composite request. Not used by individual commands.\n* 400 - Invalid request - some kind of validation failure. Syntactic issue with request, duplicate name when unique is required, values out of range, invalid characters in a string, etc.\n* 401 - Not allowed - not authenticated.\n* 403 - Not allowed - authorization failure.\n* 404 - The request is for an action on an resource that doesn't exist. This could be an invalid id in an instance URL, or an entirely invalid URL path.\n* 405 - The HTTP method is not supported on that URL.\n* 406 - Not acceptable - the server cannot satisfy the Accept: header in the request. Only application/json is supported.\n* 415 - Invalid request Content-Type.\n* 416 - Range Not Satisfiable. The client requested a starting offset (using the ?offset URL parameter, or the first value in Range header) that was larger than the number of instances in the queried result set.\n* 422 - Request syntax is correct, but server was not able to process it\n* 500 - Internal error.\n* 503 - Wait and try again.

When this occurs, you must roll back the import of the other volumes of the consistency group by executing a Cancel operation on each volume.\n* Cleanup_Failed - Indicates that there was an error while cleaning up the consistency group.\n* Invalid - Indicates that an import session is in an unexpected state.\n* Cleanup_Required - Indicates that there was an error while cleaning up the import or consistency group that requires user intervention to bring back host applications.\n* Import_Completed_With_Errors - Indicates that there was a mirror failure for one or more members while committing a consistency group due to which members were partially committed.The failed members were cancelled.\n* Import_Cutover_Incomplete - Indicates that one or more members  couldn't be committed successfully resulting in partial commit of the consistency group.
