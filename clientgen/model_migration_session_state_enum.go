// MigrationSessionStateEnum Migration session states.  * Initializing - Migration session starts and stays in this state until the session initialization completes.  * Automatic_Rescan_In_Progress - Migration session is rescanning hosts that are capable of being automatically rescanned.  * Manual_Rescan_Required - Migration session has discovered hosts that need to be manually rescanned.  * Initialized - Migration session transitions to this state when session initialization completes and no further rescans are required.  * Synchronizing - Background copy is in progress.  * Idle - Migration session transitions to this state when initial background copy completes.  * Cutting_Over - Final phase of the migration, when ownership of the volume, vVol, or application group is transferred to the new appliance.  * Deleting - Migration session is being deleted.  * Completed - Migration session is complete and it is safe to delete the session.  * Pausing - Migration session transitions to this state when the pause command is issued.  * Paused - Migration session is paused. User intervention is required to resume the session.  * System_Paused - Migration session transitions to this state if it encounters any error. User may resume or delete the migration session after resolving the error.  * Resuming - Migration session background copy being resumed.  * Failed - Migration session encountered an error.  Values was added in 3.0.0.0: Automatic_Rescan_In_Progress, Manual_Rescan_Required.
