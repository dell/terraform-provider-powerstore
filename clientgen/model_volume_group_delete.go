// VolumeGroupDelete Delete volume group request.
type VolumeGroupDelete struct {
	// By default, the members of a volume group being deleted are only removed. Set this optional parameter to true to override this behavior and also delete the members after they are removed from the volume group.  This parameter defaults to false, if not specified.
	DeleteMembers *bool `json:"delete_members,omitempty"`
	// Delete the volume group immediately and permanently, instead of moving the volume group to the Recycle Bin. If the volume group is empty or the delete_members parameter is false, this flag is ignored and the VG will be deleted immediately and permanently; A VG can only be added to the Recyle Bin if it has members and delete_members is true.  Was added in version 3.5.0.0.
	Immediate *bool `json:"immediate,omitempty"`
}
