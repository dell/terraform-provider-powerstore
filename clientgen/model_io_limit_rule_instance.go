// IoLimitRuleInstance Properties of an I/O limit rule The I/O limit rule allows users to specify I/O bandwidth limits. If both IOP and bandwidth limits are set, both are enforced.  Was added in version 4.0.0.0. This resource type has queriable association from policy
type IoLimitRuleInstance struct {
	// Unique identifier of the I/O limit rule.
	Id *string `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Name of the I/O limit rule.  This property supports case-insensitive filtering.
	Name *string                 `json:"name,omitempty"`
	Type *BandwidthLimitTypeEnum `json:"type,omitempty"`
	// Maximum I/O operations in either I/O operations per second (IOPS) or I/O operations per second per GB. The specification of the type attribute determines which measurement is used. If type is set to absolute, max_iops is specified in IOPS. If type is set to density, max_iops is specified in IOPS per GB. If both max_iops and max_bw are specified, the system will limit I/O if either value is exceeded.
	MaxIops *int32 `json:"max_iops,omitempty"`
	// Maximum I/O bandwidth measured in either Kilobytes per second or kilobtyes per second / per GB. The specification of the type attribute determines which measurement is used. If type is set to absolute, max_bw is specified in Kilobytes per second. If type is set to density, max_bw is specified in Kilobytes per second / per GB. If both max_iops and max_bw are specified, the system will limit I/O if either value is exceeded.
	MaxBw *int32 `json:"max_bw,omitempty"`
	// Percentage indicating by how much the limit may be exceeded. If I/O normally runs below the specified limit, then the volume or volume group will accumulate burst credits that can be used to exceed the limit for a short period (a few seconds, but will not exceed the burst limit). This burst percentage applies to both max_iops and max_bw and is independent of the type setting.
	BurstPercentage *int32 `json:"burst_percentage,omitempty"`
	// Localized message string corresponding to type Was added in version 4.0.0.0.
	TypeL10n *string `json:"type_l10n,omitempty"`
	// This is the inverse of the resource type policy association.
	Policies []PolicyInstance `json:"policies,omitempty"`
