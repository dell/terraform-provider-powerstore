// ImportSessionStateEnum Import session states * Scheduled - Indicates that a user scheduled the import to run at a later time. The import remains in this state and waits until the schedule expires. * Paused - Indicates that the data copy between the source and destination volumes is paused. * Queued - Indicates that all imports are queued and run in a First In First Out (FIFO) order. This occurs when there are more active import sessions than supported. * In_Progress - Indicates that a queued import session is now in progress. * Mirror_Enabled - Indicates that an import session has completed setting up the entities required to import data from the source resource. * Ready_To_Start_Copy - Indicates that an import session is ready to start the data copy operation from the source resource. * Copy_In_Progress - Indicates that the data copy between the source and destination storage systems has started. The data copy runs as a background job and updates the import session percentage complete and estimated time left for the copy. Host IOs are pointed to PowerStore in this state. The import process keeps the source and destination volumes or consistency groups volume in sync by doing IO forwarding. * Ready_For_Cutover - Indicates that you can commit the import. The import process moves to this state after it successfully copies data from the source volume or consistency group. * Cutover_In_Progress - Indicates that the cutover of volumes that are part of a consistency group is in progress. * Import_Completed - Indicates that all operations completed successfully for a given import after a commit. In this state, the source volume is no longer mapped to the host and all stale paths are cleaned up. * Cancelled - Indicates that a user forcefully cancelled the import. * Failed - Indicates that there was an error during import. The appropriate error message  is returned in the error_response object. * Cancel_Failed - Indicates that an attempt to cancel the import of a volume failed in a consistency group import. * Cancel_In_Progress - Indicates that a cancel is in progress. * Cleanup_In_Progress - Indicates that the import of one or more volumes in a consistency group failed. When this occurs, you must roll back the import of the other volumes of the consistency group by executing a Cancel operation on each volume. * Cleanup_Failed - Indicates that there was an error while cleaning up the consistency group. * Invalid - Indicates that an import session is in an unexpected state. * Cleanup_Required - Indicates that there was an error while cleaning up the import or consistency group that requires user intervention to bring back host applications. * Import_Completed_With_Errors - Indicates that there was a mirror failure for one or more members while committing a consistency group due to which members were partially committed.The failed members were cancelled. * Import_Cutover_Incomplete - Indicates that one or more members  couldn't be committed successfully resulting in partial commit of the consistency group. Commit should be tried again on the consistency group. * Cancel_Required - Indicates that agentless import has failed during copy operation and once in this state user is expected to cancel the import.  Values was added in 1.0.2: Cancel_Required.
