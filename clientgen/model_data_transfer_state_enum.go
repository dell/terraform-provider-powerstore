// DataTransferStateEnum Data transfer state of the replication session: * Asynchronous               - Data is being transferred asynchronously between source and destination. This is incremental sync cycle. * Asynchronous_Initial_Sync  - Data is being transferred asynchronously between source and destination. This is initial sync cycle. * System_Asynchronous_Initial_Sync - Metro type replication session is transferring data asynchronously. This is initial sync cycle. * System_Asynchronous              - Metro type replication session is transferring data asynchronously. This is incremental sync cycle before mirror is enabled. * Switch_To_Sync_Diff_Copy   - Metro type replication session is transferring data asynchronously. This is the last copy after mirror is enabled to switch to synchronous data transfer. * Synchronous                - Data is being transferred synchronously between source and destination. * Active_Active              - Session is active-active mode. Both local and remote storage resource are available for Production IO. IOs are synchronously replicated in both directions. * Faulted                    - Session is in faulted state. * Paused                     - Data transfer is paused.  Was added in version 3.0.0.0.
