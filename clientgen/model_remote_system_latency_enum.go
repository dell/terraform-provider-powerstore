// RemoteSystemLatencyEnum Network latency choices for a remote system. Replication traffic can be tuned for higher efficiency depending on the expected network latency. This will only be used when the remote system type is PowerStore.  * Low - Less than 5 milliseconds. * Low_Medium - Latency is greater than 5 milliseconds and less than or equal to 20 milliseconds. * Medium - Latency is greater than 20 milliseconds and less than or equal to 60 milliseconds. * Medium_High - Latency is greater than 60 milliseconds and less than or equal to 120 milliseconds. * High - More than 120 milliseconds.  All the above values are valid for TCP type data connections. Only Low and High are valid for iSCSI type data connections. In sync replication for Powerstore, if the remote system network latency is changed from Low to Other latency values, Sync replication is not supported for File and Block.  Values was added in 3.0.0.0: Low_Medium, Medium, Medium_High.
