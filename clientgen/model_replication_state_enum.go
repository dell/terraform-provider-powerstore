// ReplicationStateEnum State of the replication session: * Initializing - The replication session is being created.   The status changes to OK after the replication session is created. * OK - No other operation. The replication session is operating normally. * Synchronizing - The replication session has started either a manual or automatic synchronization. * System_Paused - Replication session operation has failed or was cancelled and moved to this state by the system.   User intervention required. * Paused - User paused the replication session. * Paused_For_Migration - Migration paused the replication session. * Paused_For_NDU - A non-disruptive upgrade paused the replication session. * Pausing - The replication session is pausing operation.   The replication state would change to Paused after the pause operation is completed. * Resuming - The replication session is resuming operation.   Once resume completes the state would be based on what activity was in-progress when it was paused. * Modify_Role_In_Progress - Replication session's role is being modified. * Failing_Over - A planned failover is in progress.   The status changes to Failed_Over after the replication session has failed over. * Failing_Over_For_DR - An unplanned failover is in progress.   The status changes to Failed_Over after the replication session has failed over. * Failed_Over - The replication session underwent a planned or unplanned failover. User intervention required. * Reprotecting - The replication session is being reprotected.   The status changes to OK after the replication session has been reprotected.  * Switching_To_Metro_Sync - Replication session transition to Metro sync mode in-progress. * Fractured - Metro replication session is fractured due to a fault.   Session is degraded and is available for production IO from preferred site settings. * Deleting - Replication session is being deleted. * Partial_OK - Replication session state for a NAS server replication,   when one or more File Systems are not replicating to the destination. * Partial_Paused - Replication session state for a NAS server replication,   when some, but not all of the File System replication sessions are in Paused state. * Partial_Failed_Over - Replication session state for a NAS server replication,   when some, but not all of the File System replication sessions are in Failed_Over state. * Partial_Reprotected - Replication session state for a NAS server replication,   when some, but not all of the File System replication sessions are re-protected successfully after a fail over. * Error - Any other failure not specified. * Switching_To_Synchronous     - Replication session transition to Synchronous mode in-progress. * Partial_Failed_Back - Replication session state for a NAS server replication, when some, but not all of the File System replication sessions are Failed_Back successfully after a failover.
