// PostEventPolicyEnum Fault tolerance level assigned for events in case of offline or unreachable file events publisher servers. Values describe the NAS Server's behavior when events cannot be processed by file events publisher servers (lost events): * Ignore - Continue server operation and tolerate lost events. If there is   no CEPA server available return no error to the caller. * Accumulate - Use a persistence file as a circular event buffer and tolerate   lost events. Continue server's operation even if the buffer is full. * Guarantee - Use a persistence file as a circular event buffer and continue   server's operation until the buffer is full. If the buffer is full deny access   to files systems where Events Publishing is Enabled. Do not tolerate lost events. * Deny - If there is no CEPA server available, deny access to files systems   where Events Publishing is Enabled. Do not tolerate lost events.  Was added in version 3.0.0.0.
