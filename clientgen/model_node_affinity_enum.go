// NodeAffinityEnum This attribute shows which node will be advertised as the optimized IO path to the volume. It is initially set to System_Select_At_Attach and can be modified to other values. When a volume is first attached to a host, if node_affinity is System_Select_At_Attach then the system will make the assignment to either System_Selected_Node_A or System_Selected_Node_B. The node_affinity may be modified to one of System_Select_At_Attach or Preferred_Node_A or Preferred_Node_B. Both System_Selected_Node_A and System_Selected_Node_B are reserved for system use only and cannot be set as the volume's node_affinity.   Possible affinity for a volume.  * System_Select_At_Attach - Volume currently has no node affinity, affinity will be assigned when the volume is first attached.  * System_Selected_Node_A - System selected Node A as the optimized IO path to volume.  * System_Selected_Node_B - System selected Node B as the optimized IO path to volume.  * Preferred_Node_A - Node A will always advertise as the optimized IO path to volume.  * Preferred_Node_B - Node B will always advertise as the optimized IO path to volume.
